# ðŸ¤” What is the `wallet-dapp`?

Crypto wallets are one of foundations of Web3. They are the gateway application into crypto ecosystems by enabling users to interact with blockchain protocols and manage digital assets.

Under the hood, wallets leverage cryptographic technologies to generate or recover private keys - a concept that we'll define in the course of this tutorial. Those private keys give users access to public accounts that record ownership on a blockchain. And those public accounts store digital assets ranging from protocol-native cryptocurrencies, project-specific tokens, and many others.

In this tutorial, you'll learn to develop a wallet for the Solana protocol. In the process, you'll dive into key concepts relevant to Web3 and start to cultivate an understanding for what it takes to build decentralized applications (dApps).

We made this decentralized application (dApp) to help developers learn about Web 3 protocols. It's a Next.js app that used React, TypeScript and various smart contract languages (mostly Solidity and Rust).

We will guide you to build up a simple web client using the various blockchain's JavaScript SDKs to interact with their networks. Each protocol is slightly different, but we have attempted to standardize the workflow so that you can quickly get up to speed on networks like Solana, NEAR, Polygon and more!


This is a Web 3 gateway tutorial app for Web 2 developers. It presents foundational dApp concepts by building a digital assets wallet for Solana.

## Readme To Be Finalized

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
